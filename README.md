# RumorSpreadingSimulation

## Getting Started- Instructions
Based Windows
write the following in the treminal or powershell and press enter:

git clone https://github.com/DanielleLevy/RumorSpreadingSimulation.git
### 2 Ways to run:
#### first way:

write the following in the terminal or powershell , after each one press enter:

1. cd RumorSpreadingSimulation

2. ./RumorSpreadingSimulation.exe

##### NOTE : if yu run fron the CMD you should write: 

1. cd RumorSpreadingSimulation

2. RumorSpreadingSimulation.exe


#### second way:

Go to the folder where the Repo file is located, enter the DIST folder, and double-click on the EXE file.

## Description:
The automaton is designed on a grid of 100 x 100 cells. The cells are uniformly distributed with a density parameter P, which represents the population density and can be varied throughout the research to study its effect on the system's behavior.


Each person in the population has a level of skepticism, which is defined as one of four levels:


S4: does not believe any rumor

S3: believes a rumor with a basic probability of 1/3

S2: believes a rumor with a basic probability of 2/3

S1: believes any rumor

Each person is randomly assigned a level of skepticism, and the task is to decide what percentage of the population falls into each skepticism level.


A random person is selected from the population to start spreading a rumor according to the following rules:


1. When a person spreads a rumor, they pass it on to all their neighbors.
2. When a person receives a rumor, they decide whether to pass it on to their neighbors based on their level of skepticism. For example, if a person has a skepticism level of S2 and receives a rumor, they have a 1/3 chance of passing it on to their neighbors. The transmission occurs immediately after receiving the rumor.
3. If a person receives the same rumor from at least two different neighbors in the same generation, their skepticism level temporarily decreases. For example, if a person has a basic skepticism level of S3 and receives the same rumor from two neighbors in the same generation, their skepticism level will temporarily become S2.
4. A person who has already passed on a rumor will not pass it on again for L generations, where L is another parameter that can be varied in the research.
After L generations, a person can pass on the rumor again if they receive it again.


The simulation ran 10 times(in defult, the user can change it) and finally a graph of the spread of the rumor was created, the graph is based on the average of all runs.
